# Business Analytics Project – RStudio Analysis

This project was completed as part of the **Business Analytics (CSE5014)** module in my *Higher Diploma in Computing & Software Engineering* program at International College of Business & Technology (ICBT).

##  Project Overview

The analysis focuses on evaluating the relationship between variables such as **prestige**, **education**, **income**, and **gender representation (women)** using RStudio. The context for the analysis simulates strategic decision-making within the **Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Sri Lanka**.

##  Key Objectives

- Perform **descriptive statistics** on numeric variables
- Analyze **central tendency** using mean, median, and mode
- Evaluate **normality** using the Shapiro-Wilk test
- Conduct **ANOVA** and **Tukey's HSD** to analyze group differences
- Build **regression models** to understand predictors of prestige
- Measure **correlations** using Pearson's method
- Apply **multiple linear regression** for deeper insight

##  Tools & Technologies

- **R**
- **RStudio**
- **Base R plotting functions**
- **Excel** (for initial data handling)

##  Summary of Key Findings

- **Education and Income** show a statistically significant **positive impact** on **Prestige**.
- **Gender representation (Women)** showed a weak, **non-significant negative correlation** with Prestige.
- **ANOVA** revealed prestige varies significantly across occupation types (**Blue-Collar**, **White-Collar**, **Professional**).
- The **multiple linear regression model** explained nearly **80% (R² = 0.7982)** of the variance in Prestige.

##  Deliverables

-  `BA_Assignment_Report.pdf` – academic write-up with all analysis details
-  `project_code.R` – executable code performing all statistical tests and plots
-  Charts – histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots generated in R

##  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Data visualization
- Linear and multiple regression
- ANOVA and post-hoc analysis
- Real-world business context application
